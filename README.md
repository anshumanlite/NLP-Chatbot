# NLP-Chatbot
In this project we will try to create a chatbot that will have only one purpose which will be to recommend laptops to the user based on their question. The idea is that the users will open start talking to the chatbot and they will ask a question, based on that question the chatbot will generate a fitting response and send it to the user. We are using two different approaches for this purpose and will be comparing their performance. The first approach is to use simple TF-IDF approach to generate responses. The second approach is to use deep learning and bag or words approach.
